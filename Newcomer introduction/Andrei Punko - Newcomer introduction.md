Hello

Some time ago I graduated from Belarusian State University with Physicist-Researcher specialization.

Before arriving to current project I worked at:
- BSUIR as a scientist / researcher where performed modeling of physical processes
- Linline as an electronics engineer where participated in construction and tuning of electronics for cosmetology lasers
- BMC as an electronics engineer and software developer where worked on prototyping of device for diesel fuels testing
- Epam Systems / Godel Technologies / Artezio / iTechArt as a software engineer where used Java stack mostly on 
different projects related with next domains: Travel / Finance / Documentation / Blockchain / Entertainment 

My hobbies in early years were reading, electronics, programming and wood carving, 
but during last years I mostly prefer just reading and programming.

What about books - I prefer technical literature (related with my specialization)
and philosophical books (written by Eastern Orthodox fathers).

What about programming:
- used Basic and Pascal in childhood / early years (20-30 years ago),
- used Pascal / C for modeling,
- use Java as main language during last time (10+ years),
- for some projects faced a bit with Groovy / Lua / Python / Go languages
- plan to use Kotlin instead of Java in future may be

To stay healthy I usually use walks/swimming and (at winter) skiing.

Sure, like to spend time with my son helping him with homework or just discussing some things.

Glad to meet you!
